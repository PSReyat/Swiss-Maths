#Swiss Maths
This is an application I designed in Angular for GCSE and A-level Maths student to help them check their answers. The name 'Swiss Maths' comes from the idea of a swiss knife that has multiple tools to help in various situations, and this app, likewise, follows the same philosophy. This is the first version and will be updated in the future with more functionality.
